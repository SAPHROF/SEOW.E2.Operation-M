# SEOW.E2.Operation-M
SEOW Philippines 1941 (E2)

After the sudden strike on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, the United States is organizing a defense for is territories and the mainland under war plan Rainbow-3. There is no greater threat to the United States than the prospect of a Japanese invasion of its territories. The Philippines are the first line of defense and The Pacific Bridgehead for any and all operations moving forward into the war.

Objectives:
Imperial Japan (IJ)
Operation-M
 * Capture Luzon in 50 days (Jan 27, 1942)
 * Destroy FEAF Bases (less than 30% aircraft capacity on US airfields)

United States (US)
War Plan Orange (Phase II)
 * Hold Manilla and Mindanao until relief force arrives
 * Sink Japanese Transport Fleet (80% of ships)

	Updated ACHS of all airfields for compatibility with Dogfight Mode SEOW
		All land Air bases reworked with new ACHS
		All Sea Bases reworked with new ACHS
			(All instances of Airbase 2005 have been replaced with 20051-20057, as each seabase location has varying geography which makes it impossible for one common shared airbase type)
	Renamed Airbases in DB/MP to those used in Full Mission Builder to maintain consistency when navigating (previous name in parenthesis)
		Iba (Palauig)
		Nielson / Nichols (Nichols)
		Clark (Del Carmen)

Justifications:	

Additional mods?
	While possible, the initial iteration of this campaign will utilize no additional client side mods, only HSFX 7.0.3 expert mode.
		
Additional non-1941 Airfield:
	As not all airfields historically present in 1941 on Luzon for the Philippines map V2 by Delvpier, this is compensated with late war airfields in other locations of the map.
	
Aircrafts:
	P-400 and P-39 (1941):
		These are available earlier than 1942, ferried from Australia.

	Ki-43 (1941):
		Available earlier than 1942
	
	P-35s:
		P-36s substitute P-35 aircraft due to lack of type in HSFX 7.0.3 (an additional P-35 mod exists https://www.sas1946.com/main/index.php/topic,2321.msg500714.html#msg500714, compatible with 4.12.2, Re.2000 can also substitute for P-35 as both have a very similar appearance due Italian designers using the P-35 as inspiration)

	H6K4s:
		H8K1s substitute the H6K4 flying boat due to lack of type in HSFX 7.0.3

	
Ships:
	Submarines for US side are reduced in number and limited to Gato and Greenling (No other US submarine types exist in HSFX 7.0.3, historically there were smaller class US submarines). There is no modeling of faulty early war US torpedoes, so a reduction in sub quantity is an alternative solution:
		USS Gato SS212                          Gato Class Sub             
		USS Greenling SS213                     Greenling Class Sub   
	
	Submarine models for JP side are substituted as follows:
		IIC	(German)	                        Ro-35 IJN Submarine   
		VIIC (German)                           I-201 IJN Submarine    
		IXB (German)                            I-361 Submarine           
		VIIB (German)                           I-15 Submarine     

	Japanese patrol Boats & Minesweepers:
		MBoat (German)							Minesweeper		
		MO-4 Class MTB (Soviet)					Patrol Boat
	
	Japense Light & Heavy Cruisers:
		Kuma CL (Japanese)						All Light 
		Zara & 									All Heavy
	
Wake Island Relief Force:
	Task Force 11, 14, 16 will reinforce the Philippines instead of Wake Island
	

Limitations:
	B-17D playable positions are restricted to Pilot and Bombardier seats, no gunners.
